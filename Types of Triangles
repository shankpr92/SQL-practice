Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

Equilateral: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Isosceles: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Scalene: It's a triangle with  sides of differing lengths.
Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.



SELECT
   CASE 
    WHEN(A+B>C) and (A+C>B) and (B+C>A)THEN
        CASE 
            WHEN(A=B) and (B=C) and (C=A) then 'Equilateral'
            WHEN (A=B)or (B=C) or (A=C)then 'Isosceles'   
            ELSE 'Scalene'
        END
    ELSE 'Not A Triangle'
    END
FROM TRIANGLES;
